# Project BA / FYP_24-25
FYP for TUD CompSci Intl Final. This project will be a web scraper that will help figure out upcoming events for peoples hobbies.

## Getting started
Please make sure that your angular version matches that in package.json

i really do not recommended trying to run this as it is currently a pain in the ass to setup

I've left the service key and my firestore api key in because I don't have time to hash it and I believe whoever is grading this won't missuse it.

If you wish to run it you can just 
```
ng serve
```

As the formatted data is already there for you in the .json, feel free to rescrap if you want to but it will take awhile because of the timeout I set so I don't get IP banned or something.
