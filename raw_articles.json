The Trailblazer needs to locate them in different areas, then defeat story opponents.\\n● Each stage from Stages 1–4 features a key enemy that possesses a corresponding Mutation Mechanic. Targeting the enemy's Mutation Mechanic is an efficient way to defeat the enemy.\\n● Every stage from Stages 1–4 all have their corresponding Stage Buffs. During battle, triggering the Mutation Mechanic will increase your Stage Buff rank and increase your characters' combat effectiveness.\\n● Stages 1–4 consist of the Buff Buildup and Final Showdown phases.\\n● In the Buff Buildup phase, there is a countdown of 3 Cycles where the enemies will continuously spawn. In this phase, you need to exploit key enemies' Mutation Mechanic to raise the Stage Buff rank as much as possible.\\n● In the Final Showdown, Trailblazers must defeat as many enemies as they can for a higher score in 4 Cycles. If you have leftover Cycles when you pass the stage, you will receive extra scores. Additionally, Stage Buff ranks cannot be increased during the Final Showdown.\\n● Stage 5 is the Titan challenge boss fight. Before you enter the stage, select any 2 accumulated Stage Buff from Stages 1–4 and use them for the final boss fight. (You can inherit the highest Stage Buff rank you've historically obtained in Stages 1–4). Defeat as many waves of enemies as possible within 4 Cycles to receive a higher score.
